# Turtle_Crossing_Gmae_Pyhton
This project will show you how much easy it is to build a classic turtle crossing game using Python's Turtle module. It is also great way to understand the concepts of class, objects and inheritance for a beginner while coding this game. It is designed in a way that if turtle crosses the the road without colliding with any car, the level changes it's difficulty by increasing the speed of cars. If the turtle collides any car, a display pops up saying "GAME OVER!!" while showing highest level count.
